## Day 1 Questions

### General Questions

1. What option did you select for your domain (Azure free domain, GoDaddydomain)?

```
Azure free domain
```
2. What is your domain name?
```
alexanderjuhansecurityresume
```
### Networking Questions

1. What is the IP address of your webpage?
```
20.211.64.11
```
2. What is the location (city, state, country) of your IP address?
```
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
```
3. Run a DNS lookup on your website. What does the NS record show?

### Web Development Questions

1. When creating your web app, you selected a runtime stack. What was it? Does it work on the front end or the back end?
```
PHP 8.1, backend
```

2. Inside the /var/www/html directory, there was another directory called assets. Explain what was inside that directory.
```
HTML assets help the page display. This can include images, as well as applications that help perform specific tasks.
```
3. Consider your response to the above question. Does this work with the front end or back end?
```
HTML deals with the front end.
```
## Day 2 Questions

### Cloud Questions

1. What is a cloud tenant?
```
A partition in a cloud environment that isolates and secures resources.
```
2. Why would an access policy be important on a key vault?
```
Access policies will ensure that Key Vaults are as secure as possible.
```
3. Within the key vault, what are the differences between keys, secrets, and certificates?
```
Secrets are passwords, keys are cryptographic keys generated by algorithms, and certificates are key pairs that allow access to data.
```
### Cryptography Questions

1. What are the advantages of a self-signed certificate?
```
Cost-efficiency. Speed and ease of access for testing purposes. Zero dependencies.
```

2. What are the disadvantages of a self-signed certificate?
```
Browsers and OSs will not recognize them. Risky for use in transactions dealing with highly sensitive data such as financial information.
Susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
```
3. What is a wildcard certificate?
```
A key that can be used with multiple sub-domains, as opposed to individualkeys for each sub-domain.
```
4. When binding a certificate to your website, Azure only provides TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.  Explain why SSL 3.0 isn’t provided.
```
SSL 3.0 poses a major security threat. MS disabled it to be safe.
```
5. After completing the Day 2 activities, view your SSLfollowing questions: certificate and answer the
    a. Is your browser returning an error for your SSLnot? certificate? Why or why
```
No, I used the free azure created site, so the SSL certificate was generatedfor me by MS.
```
b. What is the validity of your certificate (date range)?
```
03/14/2022 - 03/09/
```
c. Do you have an intermediate certificate? If so, what is it?
```
MS Azure TLS Issuing CA 01
```
d. Do you have a root certificate? If so, what is it?
```
DigiCert Global Root G
```


e. Does your browser have the root certificate in its root store?
```
Yes.
```
f. List one other root CA in your browser’s root store.
```
AAA Certificate Services
```
## Day 3 Questions

### Cloud Security Questions

1. What are the similarities and differences between Azure Web Application Gateway and Azure Front Door?
```
Both are layer 7 load balancers. Gateway is a regional service, while FrontDoor is non-regional.
```
2. A feature of the Web Application Gateway and Front Door is “SSL Offloading.” What is SSL offloading? What are its benefits?
```
SSL offloading is a process that removes SSL encryption from incoming traffic. This process relieves the usage of resources from a web server, and
uses the resources of a dedicated server.
```
3. What OSI layer does a WAF work on?
```
Layer 7.
```
4. Select one of the WAF managed rules (e.g., directory traversal, SQL injection, etc.), and define it.
```
SQL injection attacks allow hackers to inject malicious code onto a webserver. This injection triggers the back-end to execute the code that was
injected, and can allow access to restricted data. This malicious code can spread malware to clients visiting the site.
```
5. Consider the rule that you selected. Could your website (as it is currently designed) be impacted by this vulnerability if Front Door wasn’t enabled? Why or why not?
```
No, not at the moment. There is not any sensitive data that can be breached on my website, such as financial information. Additionally, there are not
any fields available for text input that would allow for SQL injection in the first place.
```
6. Hypothetically, say that you create a custom WAF rule to block all traffic from Canada. 
Does that mean that anyone who resides in Canada would not be able to access your website? Why or why not?
```
Yes, it would block most Canadians from accessing the site. The WAF rule uses a geolocation feature, and would limit access from any Canadian IP
addresses. However, there are ways around this method, such as using a VPN.
```
7. Include screenshots below to demonstrate that your web app has the following:
a. Azure Front Door enabled

b. A WAF custom rule
